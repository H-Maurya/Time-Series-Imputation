# Time Series Imputation

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for data imputation in time series forecasting using machine learning techniques. The code provides a way to handle missing values in time series data by predicting them based on the values of other features and historical data. The imputation technique is especially useful in cases where the missing data is significant, making traditional forecasting methods unreliable.

## Key Features
-The code supports different imputation techniques, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), and Last Observed Carry Forward (LOCF).
The imputation technique can be applied to both univariate and multivariate time series data.
The repository includes several Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use the code to impute missing data in real-world datasets, such as stock prices and air quality data.
